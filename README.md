## Flavors

Tuxtility flavors are forks of Tuxtility where they have more  (or less) features than Tuxtility!

For a fork of Tuxtility to be considered a offical flavor it must follow these terms

- It must have new features it can't just be a recolor or name.
- You must include credit to Tuxtility and to all of it's contributers (from the version it is based on) and the licence.
- Must have a diffrent extension id to prevent conflics.
- Must **NOT** contain any malicious code. (If it does you will be baned from the discord)
- It must not interfere with the website/page as it is aganst many sites rules (eg, PenguinMod)
- Must include TPM (Tuxtility Permission Manager) (except for flavors older than 7/20/2025)
- Must respect Scratch mod's (eg, PenguinMod) permission manager.
- Must be based on a stable version of Tuxtility.

If all of these terms are met you may summit a ticket on the discord server.
